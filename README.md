<h1>αβ-ProtBERT</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Current version of the JLPrice lab ProtBERT implementation. Modified and in-testing to process batches of sequences.
  <br><br>
  A simple implementation of BERT for multiple-mask protein predicitons for use with Google Colab.
  This implementation uses the <a href=https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/prot_bert>prot_bert</a> pretrained model.<br>
  <br>
  Eventually a full python implementation will be made for usage on local or remote machines.
  <br>
  This implementation supports both fine-tuning and multiple-mask MLM predictions.<hr>
